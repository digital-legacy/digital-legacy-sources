## Project launch history

This project came to life after [Paris Web 2015](http://www.paris-web.fr/2015/), as we realized that not so many people know how to (or even think of) handle their digital legacy. We had a [workshop (in French)](http://www.paris-web.fr/2015/ateliers/faire-son-testament-numerique.php) and we will draw from it to share our experience and provide help to put your digital legacy in place.
